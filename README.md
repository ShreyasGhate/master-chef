my recipe for momos :-

 Step 1 Prepare the vegetable stuffing
To prepare this exotic delight, first prepare the vegetable filling. To do so finely chop onion, garlic, ginger, mushroom, tofu, cabbage and cilantro. Once done mix all these vegetables in a bowl. Add soy sauce in the bowl and toss the vegetables to combine them well. Keep aside for further use.

Step 2 Prepare the dough
Next, prepare the dough for covering the momos. In a bowl add all purpose flour and water. Mix together to form a smooth dough. Cover the dough and keep aside.

Step 3 Roll out the dough and obtain several tiny circles
Now, roll out the dough using a rolling pin (similar to a chapati preparation). Roll into a thin sheet of dough, but not too thin. Out of this cut out small circles

Step 4 Stuff in the filling in the momos
Next, fill the centre of each of these circles with vegetable filling prepared in step 1. Once done, start making small folds on the inside using your thumb and forefinger. Lift the sides of the circles and seal them together using a little water. Make sure the momos are properly sealed.

Step 5 Steam the momos and serve
Finally, boil water in a steamer. Once the water boils, add momos in the steamer. Leave them undisturbed for 15-20 minutes. Take out and serve ht with dip or chutney of your choice.
